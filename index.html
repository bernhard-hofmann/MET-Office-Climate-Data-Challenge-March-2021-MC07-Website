				<p>"Since the industrial revolution, <em>oceans have absorbed 25% of human produced CO2</em>"</p>
				<p>
					<span class="image left"><img src="images/traffic.jpg" alt="traffic" /></span>
					Since pre-industrial times the ocean has taken up over 25% of the anthropogenic CO2 from emissions to the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels, absorbed over 90% of the heat energy from global warming and received 100% of the water from melting ice, which have led oceans to warm, acidify and loose oxygen, and sea levels to rise worldwide. As CO2 emissions increase the impact on the ocean, its physical and chemical properties, its vast biodiversity and ecosystems, as well as the risk and vulnerability of dependent ocean and coastal industries and economies, and human communities will intensify greatly (IPCC SROCC).</p>

					<h2>How do we know</h2>
				</header>
				<p>Marine scientists across the globe have been collecting ocean data for the past 50 years. <a href="http://www.goa-on.org/">Global Ocean Acidification Observing Network (GOA-ON)</a> are a network of scientists who collate ocean acidification data.
					Plymouth Marine Laboratory contribute to GOA-ON in a number of ways including submitting data from the AMT (Atlantic Meridional Transect) which has been running since 1995.</p>

					<h2>Impact of ocean acidification</h2>
				</header>
				<p>The impacts of ocean acidification have been increasingly investigated over the past decade. Laboratory studies have shown that species have differing sensitivities to ocean acidification, with effects being found on processes ranging from individual physiology, energy budgets, growth, and reproduction to survival, behaviour, community shifts, food web dynamics, and nutrient cycling. Ultimately these shifts in the marine ecosystem have consequences for people through increased risk to food security, tourism, coastal protection, livelihood, human health, and feedback on climate.</p>
				<p>Many of these impacts are predicted to occur by the year 2100 if we do not reduce emissions of CO2.</p>
				<p>The Ocean Acidification International Coordination Centre (OA-ICC) and GOA-ON can provide summaries of these impacts, as well as links to the scientific studies.</p>
				<p>Although many impacts found in laboratory studies will not be observed in the oceans until later this century, we are already able to observe several impacts related to ocean acidification and warming.</p>

				<h2>OBSERVED IMPACTS IN THE OCEANS TODAY</h2>

				<h5>Oyster hatcheries</h5>
				<p>Oyster hatcheries along the west coast of North America have seen reduced hatching success as a result of more acidic waters coming into the areas where they collect water for their hatcheries.
					Read more about how <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.hatcheryinternational.com/oceans-changing-chemistry-slows-growth-of-oyster-larvae-study-finds/">the changing oceans chemistry slows growth of Oyster larvae</a>.
				</p>

				<h5>Pteropods</h5>
				<p>Pteropods (also a very photogenic species), tiny free-swimming sea snails, that are important food source for fish, including salmon, are being found with their shells cracked and pitted in parts of the Southern Ocean, Arctic Ocean and ocean regions where the waters are already moving towards lower pH conditions.

				</p>

				<h5>Coral Reefs</h5>
				<p>Coral on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia, has shown a decrease in calcification since 1990, and a decrease in growth over the period 1988–2003.</p>
				<p>Ocean acidification has also been shown to weaken coral skeletons.<br>
